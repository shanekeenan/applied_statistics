    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will analyze the [PlantGrowth R dataset](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/PlantGrowth.csv).\n",
    "You will find [a short description](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/datasets/PlantGrowth.html) of it on [Vicent Arel-Bundock's Rdatasets page](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/).\n",
    "The dataset contains two main variables, a treatment group and the weight of plants within those groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to perform t-tests and ANOVA on this dataset while describing the dataset and explaining your work.\n",
    "In doing this you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download and save the dataset to your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Describe the data set in your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe what a t-test is, how it works, and what the assumptions are.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Perform a t-test to determine whether there is a significant difference between the two treatment groups `trt1` and `trt2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Perform ANOVA to determine whether there is a significant difference between the three treatment groups `ctrl`, `trt1`, and `trt2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Explain why it is more appropriate to apply ANOVA rather than several t-tests when analyzing more than two groups.\n"
